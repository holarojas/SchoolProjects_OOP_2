During Workshop #6, I practiced creating more overload operator functions and helper functions.

Specifically, I had to use the copy constructor and copy assignment operator, which was really confusing because all of the object's data members were dynamically assigned char arrays. And I find char and string manipulation one of the most challenging topics in programming C or C++ because we always need to think about memory boundaries and take care of memory deallocation.

I also learned how to overload the input and output operators and how to combine them with reading and printing functions, all while creating dynamically allocated char arrays.

I believe iostream and iostream are topics that I should practice more to feel confident about programming.
