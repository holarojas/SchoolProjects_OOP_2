For Workshop #7, I needed to use Derived classes. With the project and the last workshops, I feel we are truly putting it all together. From creating classes and member functions to memory management and more object-oriented concepts. 
Workshop #7 was a bit easier because now all the instructions are given, but it is still challenging to get the correct logic for each function.
Until today I have only completed MS1 of the project, and it has been a bit overwhelming because now we don't get much help from the readMe file. It was a rough start, but once I get to it, I can get back to check my notes and was able to complete the MS.
