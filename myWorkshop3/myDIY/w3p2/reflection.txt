During this week, we learned more concepts about object-oriented programming. We learned how to create classes, how they are different from structs, and how to control the privacy of the client code's access to our class information.

We also learned the difference between data members and member functions inside a class. This lab mainly focused on that concept and how we can code it.
To keep a correct encapsulation of the class, we learned about the Constructor and Destructor concepts, which I utilized in this lab. Even though my code worked before I added those specifications, I believe it is essential to keep the code clean and follow the design best practices.

Finally, we learned about the Current object and how to access it with the "this" keyword. I used it in my code to access the Train class data members through the global function.
